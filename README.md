# Transformer-based-Text-Processing-Model
The project implements a Transformer model to process and generate text and to perform  natural language processing tasks like text generation, language translation, and summarization. The model excels in understanding relationships between words, regardless of their position in a sentence, using attention mechanisms and neural networks.

Project Overview
The Transformer model in this project:
1.)Processes text: Converts input text into meaningful vector representations.
2.)Understands relationships: Uses self-attention mechanisms to identify important words in context.
3.)Generates outputs: Predicts the next word or sequence of words based on learned patterns.


Project Flow
1.)Input Data:Takes sentences or words as input.
2.)Tokenization:Breaks text into tokens (e.g., words or subwords).
3.)Embedding Layer:Converts tokens into dense vector representations, making the input understandable to the model.
4.)Positional Encoding:Adds positional information to vectors to help the model understand the order of words.
5.)Self-Attention Mechanism:Focuses on important words in a sentence using:

Query (Q): Represents the word currently being analyzed.
Key (K): Compares other words to the current word.
Value (V): Holds the actual information for each word.

6.)Layer Normalization:Stabilizes training by ensuring outputs of each layer have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
7.)Multi-Head Attention:Allows the model to focus on multiple aspects of the input simultaneously, such as different meanings or relationships between words.
8.)Feed Forward Neural Network (FFN):Processes the refined attention outputs through fully connected layers for further learning.
9.)Output (Logits):Outputs logits, which represent the unscaled probabilities of each token.
Logits are converted to probabilities using softmax.
10.)raining (Cross-Entropy Loss):During training, the model minimizes the cross-entropy loss by comparing predicted tokens with actual tokens.
11.)Text Generation:Once trained, the model generates text sequences by predicting one token at a time based on prior inputs.
